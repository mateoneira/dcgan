# DCGAN
pytorch implementation of deep convolutional generative adversarial network

## Overview
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using PyTorch. DCGANs are capable of generating realistic images by training two neural networks against each other.

## Model Architecture
- Generator: Uses transposed convolutions to generate images
- Discriminator: Uses convolutional layers to classify images
